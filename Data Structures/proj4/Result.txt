   Result: Assignment 4
   Name: Paul Kafka

I tested my Binary search tree code by using a simple test 
driver porgram which used the BST. I check for the following errors:
	1) The data was being inserted
	2) The data was adhering to the BST rules
	3) The BST printed preorder traversal correctly
To test the perfromance of the code, I used "#include <sys/time.h>". 
With this I was able to see the time at which the program executed
different function and how it ran. I used it on Assignment 3 to compare
to Assignment 4 and the results were as expected. Assignment 4 had better
times. A BST was just faster then a link list at searching (which is used
a lot).
