Your program should accept moves from a human, and should make good moves in its turn, in trying to win the game. </p><p><b>Background:</b> Tic-tac-toe is normally played with a <i>3x3</i></span> array.  This can be generalized tobigger arrays. All cells in the array are initially unmarked. Two playerstake turns marking previously unmarked cells, with the first playermaking an <i>X</i><span style='font-style:normal'> mark and the secondplayer making a </span><i>0</i><span style='font-style:normal'>mark. The game ends if (i) either player wins, or (ii) the game istied, because neither player wins. A player wins if he has a specifiednumber of consecutive marks along a line. These consecutive marks caneither be along a horizontal line, a vertical line, or a diagonal. Adiagonal is as explained below. Let the cells be numbered so that thebottom left cell is denoted by </span><i>(1,1)</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> and the top right by</span><i>(n,n)</i><span style='font-style:normal'> in an </span><i>nx n</i><span style='font-style: normal'> array. A diagonal goingNorth-East will have cell </span><i>(i+1,j+1)</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> adjacent to cell </span><i>(i,j)</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>, while a cell going North-West will hascell </span><i>(i-1,j+1)</i><span style='font-style:normal'> adjacentto cell (i,j). <ahref="http://boulter.com/ttt/">http://boulter.com/ttt/</a> has anexample of a tic-tac-toe game. They permit an array that has a heightdifferent from its width. But we will require the height and the widthto be equal. You should evaluate <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yosenl/extras/alphabeta/alphabeta.html">game trees</a> with recursion to try to win the game.  <p><b>Deliverables:</b></p><ul> <li>Create     a subdirectory called <CODE>TicTacToe</CODE>.</li> <li>You     will need to have a <CODE>makefile</CODE> in this directory. In addition, all the     header and cpp files needed to build your software must be present here, as well as the <CODE>LOG.txt</CODE> file.</li><LI> You should create the following additional file.<UL><LI><EM>main.cpp:</EM> This is the main program. It will accept three commandline arguments. The command: <CODE>./proj2 &lt;n&gt; &lt;m&gt; &lt;h/c&gt;</CODE>will cause a tic-tac-toe game to be played using an <i>n x n</i> array, with <i>m</i> marks in a line needed to win. The argument <i>h</i> will cause the human to play first, while a <i>c</i> will cause the computer to play first. For example, <CODE>./proj24 3 h</CODE> will play a tic-tac-toe game ona <i>4x4</i> array, with <i>3</i> consecutive marks required to win, and the humanplaying first. Whenever it is the human's turn to play, the program shouldpresent the current state of the game, and specify how the human should let thecomputer know about his/her move. The human has unlimited time to make a move.However, the computer should complete its move within <i>5</i> seconds. The program should also give the correctfinal result of the game.</ul></ul> <p><b>Notes: </b><OL><li> You can get up to 10 bonus points if your code wins a tic-tac-toe tournament that we will organize, competing against other tic-tac-toe programs. <LI> You will be graded on your user interface too.<LI> You may use any STL feature for this part of the assignment.<LI> You must use a game tree for at least a few levels of recursion, after which you may use some intelligent strategy to evaluate a position.<LI> You may form groups of up to 4 students each if you wish to. In this case, please email me the names of all group members by Sep 15, with a cc to each group member, and also include the names of the group members in the log file.<LI> The size of the problem will be at most <code>10 x 10</code>.</OL> <HR><FONT -2>Last modified: 14 Sep 2012</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></body></html>
