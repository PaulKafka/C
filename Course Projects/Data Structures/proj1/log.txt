Sep 11, 2012: I finished writing my implemination file. All the code is written, so now its time to debug.
Sep 12, 2012: I kept debugging my code. I couldnt finish in time to turn it in.
Sep 13, 2012: I kept debugging my code. I was having trouble with the delimeter filtering for Analyze();
Sept 14, 2012: I commented all over and organized my code well. I couldnt get the calculations correct.
				The ddd Debugger was SUPER slow and laggy and served no purpose. I then turned the proj1 in.
