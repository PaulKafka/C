<p align="left">This assignment asks you to write a program to analyze a web page HTML file.&nbsp;   Your program will read one character at a time from the file specifying the web   page, count various attributes in the code for the page, and print a report to   the console window giving information about the coding of the page. </p>
<p align="left">Note that a search engine like Google uses at least one technique along   similar lines.&nbsp; To calculate how popular (frequently visited or cited) a web   page is, one technique is to look at as many other worldwide web pages as   possible which are relevant, and count how many links the world's web pages have   back to the target page.</p>

</ul>
</ul>

<h3>
<b>Problem Statement</b></h3>
<p>Your program will analyze the way in which a web page is encoded.&nbsp; The   program will ask the user for the name of a file containing a web page   description.&nbsp; This input file must be stored in the same folder as your program   files, and it must be encoded using hypertext markup language, or HTML. The   analysis requires that you find the values of the following items for the page: </p>
<UL>
  <LI>number of lines (every line ends with the EOLN marker; there will be an EOLN   in front of the EOF)   
  <LI>number of tags (includes links and comments)   
  <LI>number of links   
  <LI>number of comments in the file   
  <LI>number of characters in the file (note that blanks and EOLNs do count)   
  <LI>number of characters inside tags   
  <LI>percentage of characters which occur inside tags, out of the total </LI>
</UL>
Here is an example of a very simple HTML file:
<p>&lt;html&gt;<BR>
  &lt;TITLE&gt;Course Web   Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;<BR>
  This course is about programming<BR>
  in C++.</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a   href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/somefile.html"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;!-- almost done!   --&gt;<BR>
  &lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p><BR>
  You may assume that the HTML files you must analyze use a very limited   subset of basic HTML, which includes only the following "special" items: <BR>
  &nbsp;</p>
<CENTER>
  <TABLE width="75%">
    <TBODY>
      <TR>
        <TD align="left"><STRONG><EM>tag</EM></STRONG></TD>
        <TD>always starts with '&lt;' and ends with '&gt;'</TD>
      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD><STRONG><EM>link</EM></STRONG></TD>
        <TD>always starts with "&lt;a" or "&lt;A" and ends with '&gt;'</TD>
      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD><STRONG><EM>comment</EM></STRONG></TD>
        <TD>always starts with "&lt;!--" and ends with   "--&gt;"</TD>
      </TR>
    </TBODY>
  </TABLE>
</CENTER>
<p>You may assume that a less-than symbol ('&lt;') <U>ALWAYS</U> indicates the   start of a tag. A tag in HTML denotes an item that is not displayed on the web   page, and often gives instructions to the web browser. For example,   &lt;title&gt; indicates that the next item is the overall title of the document,   and &lt;/title&gt; indicates the end of that section. In tags, both upper and   lowercase letters can be used. </p>
<p>Note on links and comments: to identify a link, you may just look for an 'a'   or 'A' which occurs just after a '&lt;'. To identify a comment, you may just   look for a '!' which follows just after a '&lt;' (that is, you do not have to   check for the two hyphens). </p>
<p>You may assume that these are the only HTML language elements you need to   recognize, and that the HTML files you process contain absolutely no HTML syntax   errors. </p>
<p>Note: it is both good style because readability is increased, and convenient,   to declare named constants for characters that are meaningful, for example </p>
<p>const char TAG_OPEN =   '&lt;';</p>
<h3>
<b>Sample Input Files</b></h3>
<p>Program input is to be read from a text file. Your program must ask the user   for interactive input of the file name. You can declare a variable to store the   file name and read the user's response exactly as shown in lecture. We declared   the name as a <EM>string</EM> of characters using the C++ string class. Then, if   your variable is called fileName, you can open the file using </p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>inFile.open(fileName.c_str());</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
If the file will not open   using the name entered (that is, the value of inFile is NULL (zero) just after   the call to open), re-prompt the user for a file name, and continue to do so   until you finally are able to open the file successfully.
<p>You may assume that file names do <EM>not</EM> contain blanks.&nbsp; The only data   error checking required is that described for the interactive input of the file   name. </p>
<p>Two sample files are provided to you on Blackboard.&nbsp; Download the files into   the same folder where you have saved your .cpp program file, as shown in   lecture.&nbsp; The two sample files are: <A href="183.html"><EM>3014</EM></A><EM><A href="183.html">.html</A> </EM>and <EM><A href="test.html">test.html</A>.</EM>&nbsp;   Start by testing your program on the smaller file, test.html. When your program   works for that file, run it using the longer file 3014.html. You may want to   test your program using other HTML files that you create yourself.&nbsp; The grader may use   other files in testing your program. The only characters in the files will be   printable characters, blanks, EOLN markers and the one EOF marker. </p>
<h3><font face="monospace" size="2"><br>
</font><b>Your  Output with Results of the Analysis </b></h3>
<p>Your program must contain the usual titles, labels, interactive prompts etc.   as required by the programming style guidelines for this course (see style   handout on course web site). You must also echoprint the complete input data   file as is. After the file has been echoprinted, print the values of all of the   required items described above. Print the percentage in the format XX.XX %,   where each 'X' represents a decimal digit (but do NOT show leading zeros).</p>
<p>Sample output for the test.html input file is provided on the class web site.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Tips and Information </h3>
<p>You should not read the file more than once to perform the analysis.&nbsp; Reading the file more than once is inefficient.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The simplest, most reliable and consistent way to check for an end of file condition on a loop is by checking for the fail state, as shown in lectures.&nbsp; The eof function is not as reliable or consistent and is simply deemed &quot;flaky&quot; by many programmers as it can behave inconsistently for different input files. </p>
<p>You may use only <U>while</U> loops on this project if you wish; you are not required to choose   amongst while, do while and/or for loops until project 4 and all projects   thereafter.&nbsp; Do not create any functions other than main() for this program.&nbsp; Do   not use data structures such as arrays.&nbsp;You may only have ONE <EM>return</EM> statement and NO <EM>exit</EM> statements in your code.&nbsp; You may only use <EM>break</EM> statements inside a <EM>switch</EM> statement in the manner   demonstrated in class; you may not use break&nbsp; or continue statements inside   loops.<br>

<h3>What File To Turn In and How to Turn In Your Work using Blackboard</h3>
You must turn in your C++ program source file, which must be named&nbsp; <font color="#3333CC" size="+1"><strong><em>htmlfile.cpp</em></strong></font><em><BR>
</em><BR>
Be 100% certain you have <STRONG><EM>thoroughly</EM></STRONG> read the handout entitled <STRONG><EM>"Submitting Your Program Assignments Electronically Using   Blackboard"</EM></STRONG> for complete instructions on how to submit and how to <STRONG>verify your submission</STRONG> after you submit it.&nbsp; This will help you   to avoid losing large numbers of project points due to improper submission   issues. This handout is available on the course web site under "Handouts."<BR>
