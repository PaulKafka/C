<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To write a program which requires the manipulation of
one-dimensional arrays</li>
  <li>To utilize parallel arrays</li>
  <li>To set up array types using the typedef construct </li>
  <li>To perform frequency counting and draw a histogram to represent
	data</li>
	<li>To perform text file input</li>
	<li>To design a program on your own which is well-structured, modular, 
	utilizing multiple functions and parameter passing appropriately</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Problem Statement</h3>
Your Xenobiology professor has decided to give you a completely True/False final exam. Since she discovered
you
are a C++ programmer, she has offered you extra credit if you will
write
a program to analyze the test data. This sounds good, so you have
accepted
the job.
<p>Your task is to analyze the data file which contains the test answer
key and each student's answers. To do this you will determine each
student's
test score and the mean for the entire class. Also you will generate a
histogram using the test scores. There are exactly 25 students who took
the exam.
</p>
<p>Calculate the mean exam score as the sum of all scores divided by the
number
of scores, as a real number.&nbsp; Display the mean in your output with 2 digits of precision. </p>
<h3>
Input</h3>
The input file is named <span style="font-style: italic;">xfile.txt</span>,
and is available from the course web site.&nbsp; You may hardcode this specific filename into your program.&nbsp; Download the file from the
course web space into
the same folder which contains your .cpp file.&nbsp; The
file has the following format:
<p>1st data line: the test answer key, in columns 1 thru 30 (there are
exactly 30 questions on the test)
</p>
<p>Remaining data lines: a student name on one line, followed by the
test
answers recorded for that student on the
next line. This pattern is repeated for all 25 students. The list is
in alphabetical order by student name, and all data
lines contain the required information starting in column one.
</p>
<p>Example data:
</p>
<p><tt>TFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTF</tt>
<br>
<tt>Einstein, Albert</tt>
<br>
<tt>TFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTF</tt>
<br>
<tt>Jones, Forgetfull</tt>
<br>
<tt>FTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFT</tt>
</p>
<p>etc...<br>
</p>
<p>BAD DATA: the only bad data you are required to check for is test
answers which are
not
the upper case letters 'T' or 'F'.&nbsp; If an&nbsp;
invalid character is found, count the invalid character as a "wrong"
answer, and continue processing the data line
normally.&nbsp; However do print an error message as part of the output
table which indicates what has occurred.&nbsp; You
may assume that the test answer key is completely valid, and so are
the student names.
</p>
<p>You are required to implement a check to see if the data file has
opened
successfully, and if it has not, your code must terminate the program
with
a descriptive error message. You may use either the return function and
implement a second return in main (like the return (EXIT_FAILURE) shown
in lecture 17), or you may use the exit function and exit from any
function
in the program, as shown in the same lecture.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Echoprinted input (some of which is included in items below).</li>
  <li>A table giving the list of student names in the order they were
read in,
the test answers for that student, and the student's test score. This
table
will incorporate data error messages if needed.</li>
  <li>The mean test score.</li>
  <li>A histogram showing the number of students who received scores in
the following
ranges: 0 thru 5, 6 thru 10, 11 thru 15, 16 thru 20, 21 thru 25, and 25
thru 30. The&nbsp; histogram should look something like this:<br>
    <br>

<h3>Data Structures</h3>
This project is intended to familiarize you with the use of
standard one-dimensional
arrays, parallel arrays, and basic use of the string class in C++.&nbsp; You are required
to
use 
one-dimensional arrays to store the
test answer key (a one-dimensional array of char), the student's answers (a parallel one-dimensional array of char), and the frequency counts (a 
one-dimensional array of int) required for the
histogram.&nbsp;
<p>Use a C++ string class object to read, store and print out each student's name.&nbsp; Use either a C-string or the string class to hard-code your file name, which should be a string <em>constant</em> in this program. </p>
<p>You are <EM>required</EM> to use these core-language one-dimensional arrays and C++   string class objects in this project. <EM>You may not use</EM> any   two-dimensional arrays, structs or user-defined classes on this project.&nbsp; You   also <EM>may not use</EM> the C++ Standard Template Library classes or   algorithms with the exception of using the C++ string class to store and work   with the file name and student name string data in this program.</p>
<p>You must use the <em>typedef</em> construct to create your array types for the exam answer arrays and for the frequency counting array. </p>

	<h3>Use Of Functions and Program Modularity </h3>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Part of your grade on this and all future course 
	programming projects will be determined by&nbsp;how well you utilize functions 
	and parameters appropriately.&nbsp; Start by working on a good design, structure 
	chart, etc.&nbsp; Your program must represent a modular, functionally cohesive design following class style 
	guidelines.&nbsp; You should have <em>at least</em> main plus four other functions in this program. 
</div>
<h3>What File To Turn In and How to Turn In Your Work using Blackboard<O:P></O:P></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">You must turn in your C++ program source file, which must be 
named<span class="style1"> grades.cpp</span><br>
<br>
Be 100% certain you have <STRONG><EM>thoroughly</EM></STRONG> read the handout   entitled <STRONG><EM>"Submitting Your Program Assignments Electronically Using   Blackboard"</EM></STRONG> for complete instructions on how to submit and how to <STRONG>verify your submission</STRONG> after you submit it.&nbsp; This will help you   to avoid losing large numbers of project points due to improper submission   issues. This handout is available on the course web site under "Handouts."</p>
