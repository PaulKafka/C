<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
 
<ul>
   <li>To write a program which requires the creation and manipulation of an 
    <em>array of structs</em></li>
   <li>To utilize the <em>typedef</em> construct to create and work with the array of structs </li>
   <li>To utilize C++ strings to work with textual data (the C++ string class)</li>
	<li>To practice more advanced file input</li>
	<li>To make use of a standard sorting algorithm, the <em>selection sort</em></li>
	<li>To perform a common real-world process which is typically done using software </li>
</ul>
 
<h3> Problem Statement</h3>
 In the spirit of the Olympics, we will now work on analyzing scores for an Olympic sport.&nbsp; Twenty-four famous scientists have decided to  participate in a special diving&nbsp;competition. The scientists will be judged  according to Olympic regulations. There will be two rounds of dives,  and each participant will make one dive per round.
 <p>&nbsp;Each dive is judged by 7 judges. Points for  the dive are assigned &nbsp;according to the following:<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. each judge assigns a score between 0.0  and 10.0 inclusive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. the highest and lowest scores are  eliminated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. the five remaining scores are summed and  the total is multiplied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by 0.6. This result is then multiplied by  the degree of difficulty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the dive (0.0 to 3.0) to find the  total score for the round.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Note: it is possible that more than one  score is &quot;lowest,&quot; and/or more than one is  &quot;highest&quot; - in these cases one of them is eliminated from the summing. In the  most extreme case, if all scores were equal, you would  eliminate two of them from the &quot;total&quot; calculations. </p>
 <p>After the two rounds, the divers with the ten  highest totals will be&nbsp;flown to London, England in 2012 to  participate in a special diving competition for famous scientists only. Your  task is to write a program to evaluate the results of these two initial  rounds. </p>
 <h3>Input</h3>
 <p>The data file provided on the class web site is named <em>diveData.txt</em>.&nbsp; You 
	may assume the data file is not empty and is completely correct.&nbsp; </p>
 <p>You may hardcode the name of the input file directly into your program. You must implement a check to see if the file specified does  open, and if it does not, terminate the run using either return in main or exit in another function, as discussed in lectures.&nbsp; If this occurs be sure to print out an appropriate error message for the user. </p>
 <p>The data file will contain information for the two  rounds of diving competition. First, there will be 48 lines  giving the results for each dive in round one, then another 48 lines will  give the results for round two. Each dive's data will contain two lines:<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. diver's name, starting in column 1, up to  25 characters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. dive difficulty level, a real number, then the 7 scores for the dive, all real numbers <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;The real number values will be separated from  each other by at least one blank.&nbsp; </p>
 <h3>Output</h3>
 <p>For this project, you will   design  appropriate output 
   yourself.&nbsp; Use your imagination.&nbsp; Follow the style guidelines for 
   output we have been discussing and demonstrating all semester.&nbsp; Here are the
   basic requirements for this program: </p>
 <p>Print the results of round one and round two in two separate tables.&nbsp; These tables will include this information for each diver: name, degree of difficulty for the dive, the 7 scores, and the total score on this round.</p>
 <p>Next, print out a final standings table sorted in descending order by final total score for all divers with this information for each diver: name, final total score (sum of total scores for each round).</p>
 <p>Finally, print a list of the <em>names</em> of the 10 divers, also in descending order ranked by score, who will be allowed to go on to  the next competition.</p>
 <p>Note: you must use the <em>Selection Sort</em> as presented in lectures to perform sorting tasks in this program.  </p>
 <p><em>EXAMPLE  CALCULATIONS </em><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Given the following difficulty rating and  scores:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span class="style2">&nbsp;Round 1: 2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.0 5.0 6.7 7.8 5.6 8.9 7.6<br>
&nbsp;Round 2: 2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.0 5.0 6.5 7.8 5.6 8.8 5.0<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;Round 1 total is: 46.506<br>
&nbsp;Round 2 total is: 38.934<br>
&nbsp;Final total score is: 85.440</span></p>

	<h3>Use Of Functions</h3>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Part of your grade on this programming project will be 
	determined by&nbsp;how well you utilize functions and parameters appropriately.&nbsp; 
	Start by working on a good design, structure chart, etc.&nbsp; Your program 
	should represent a modular, cohesive design following class 
	style guidelines.</div>
 
<h3>Use Of Data Structures and Data Types</h3>
 <p>You must use an <em>array of structs</em> as the major data structure on this project 
   with each struct as 
   specified  in this write-up.&nbsp; You must use the C++ string class to store and manipulate the diver names. </p>
 <p><EM>You may not use</EM> any   user-defined classes on this project.&nbsp; You   also <EM>may not use</EM> the C++ Standard Template Library classes or   algorithms with the exception of using the C++ string class to store and work with the name string data in this program.</p>
 <p>Use  the <EM>typedef</EM> construct to create and work with your array of structs type.</p>
 <p>You will set up an array of structs which will contain  one record for each diver. Each record must contain the diver's name, the  degree of difficulty and scores for each of his/her 2 dives, and the  total score for the diver.&nbsp; Store the diver's 7 scores on the 2 dives in either a  (1) 2-dimensional array field inside the diver's record or (2) two 1-dimensional array fields inside the diver's record. </p>
 <p>You should only have one array of structs declared in this program.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3><STRONG>Regarding FSU Computer Competency Requirement</STRONG></h3>
 <p>This assignment is assessed according to the FSU Computer Competency   Requirement.&nbsp; As such students must demonstrate (1) competent use of a   discipline-specific software package: Microsoft Visual Studio C++ and (2) the   ability to perform simple transactions using the web/Internet: obtaining all of   the assignment materials from the class web site and downloading the required   file(s), and turning in the completed work correctly to the class web site.</p>
 <h3>What File To Turn In and How to Turn In Your Work using Blackboard<o:p></o:p></h3>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">Turn in your C++ program source file, which must be named<span class="style1"><em><strong> diving</strong></em><STRONG><EM>.cpp</EM></STRONG><BR>
  </span><BR>
  Be 100% certain you   have <STRONG><EM>thoroughly</EM></STRONG> read the handout entitled <STRONG><EM>"Submitting Your Program Assignments Electronically Using   Blackboard"</EM></STRONG> for complete instructions on how to submit and how to <STRONG>verify your submission</STRONG> after you submit it.&nbsp; This will help you   to avoid losing large numbers of project points due to improper submission   issues. This handout is available on the course web site under "Handouts.""</p>
