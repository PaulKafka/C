<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This assignment requires you to
design, write, test and debug a C++ program on your own for the first time this semester. You
will create and submit a program which meets the requirements described
in this write-up.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Learning Objectives</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">To gain experience designing, writing 
	and testing
your own C++ program</font></li>
  <li> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">To understand the use of
library
functions
to perform interactive I/O</font></li>
  <li> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">To practice output formatting</font></li>
  <li> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">To create arithmetic calculations, 
	logical expressions and selection statements in C++</font></li>
  <li> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">To declare and utilize constants and
variables appropriately</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial">Problem Statement</font></b>
<p>An internet service provider has three different subscription packages for 
its customers.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Package A: For $9.95 per month 10 hours of access are provided.&nbsp; 
	Additional hours are $2.00 per hour.</li>
	<li>Package B: For $14.95 per month 20 hours of access are provided.&nbsp; 
	Additional hours are $1.00 per hour.</li>
	<li>Package C: For $19.95 per month unlimited access is provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your task is to write a program that calculates a customer's monthly bill.&nbsp; 
The program must ask the user which package the customer has purchased and how 
many hours were used for the current month.&nbsp; It must then display the total 
amount due.</p>
<p>In addition to calculating the monthly bill for the user's current package, 
your program must do the following: display how much money Package A customers 
would save if they purchased packages B or C, and how much money Package B 
customers would save if they purchased Package C.&nbsp; If there would be no 
savings, no message would be printed for a particular case.</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Input/Output</font></b></p>
<p>Use entirely <i>interactive</i> I/O in this 
program, i.e. all input is typed in at the keyboard by the user (person running 
the program), and all output goes to the text (console) window.</p>
<p>First, your program must print an introductory output title, and then prompt the 
user for the plan code.&nbsp; Allow for A, B or C, in upper or lower case.&nbsp; 
Next ask the user for the number of hours and read this as a whole number. </p>
<p>Be sure to read the section on &quot;Bad Data Checking&quot; below.</p>Remember to use good style in your program, and make it as <i>user-friendly</i> 
as possible.&nbsp; Make your input prompts and other output as clear and 
well-formatted as 
possible.<p><b><font face="Arial">Bad Data Checking</font></b>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Geneva">Your program must check 
for two kinds of bad input data: (1) verify that the user selects only A, B or C 
for the service package (in upper or lower case) and (2) the number of hours in a month cannot be less 
than zero and cannot exceed 744 (the number of hours in a month with 31 days).</span></p>
<p>First, ask the user for the service plan code.&nbsp; If that code is invalid, 
print an error message and do not ask the user for the number of hours.&nbsp; If 
the service plan code is valid, do ask the user for the number of hours.&nbsp; 
If the number of hours entered is invalid, then print an error message 
indicating that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You may assume for this program that when asked for a character, the user types a single 
non-blank character and then hits enter.&nbsp; You may also assume for this 
program that when asked for a whole 
number, the user types an integer value and then hits enter.</p>
<p>Calculate the monthly bill amount only if the service plan code entered and 
the number of hours entered are both valid inputs.</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Sample Run Output</font></b></p>
<p>Here is a sample output from a run with all valid input data:</p>

<br>
Which package does the customer use (A, B, or C)? A<br>
How many hours did the customer use last month? 12<br>

<p>Here is a sample run showing what happens when invalid input for the service 
plan code is received:</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Your output must provide all required 
elements and follow the style guidelines for this course.&nbsp; The output above 
is just a suggestion which meets the program requirements.&nbsp; You may be 
creative and display fancier output if you like!</font></p>
<p>Be sure you have read and followed the C++ Style Guidelines handout, which is a required reading assignment. </p>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Test Data Sets</font></h3>
<p>We suggest that you<span style="font-family:Geneva"> start by running your program 
and testing it using the following data.&nbsp; Use a calculator to 
check your program's results for correctness.&nbsp; Make up your own test data as well, 
planning how to test the program for all possible cases which may occur.</span></p>

<p>Keep in mind that your program must work 
correctly for all possible valid data sets, as well as handling the errors 
described in the preceding section.&nbsp; The graders will run your program and test it 
with data sets other than those six listed here.</p>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Note About C++ Header Files and Other 
  Grading Issues</font></h3>
The grader will take off points for missing required header files. Be sure to   include the headers which you need. &nbsp; Note that you may only use standard ANSI   C++ header files for all projects in this course.&nbsp;
<p>IMPORTANT: These header files are <EM>NOT</EM> standard: stdafx.h and   conio.h.&nbsp; If you set your project up as specified in the course handout on   creating Visual C++ projects, you will not have problems with non-standard   header files appearing in your code.</p>
<p>Be sure to read the generic grading guidelines for this project for further   information which may affect your grade.</p>
<H3>Miscellanous</H3>
<p>Be sure to read and understand the sections   in the Course Syllabus and Policies   handout on general project requirements.&nbsp; Also be sure to study the   style, documentation and formatting guidelines discussed in the <em>Programming   Style Guidelines </em>handout and in the lecture, textbook and recitation   sections. <br>
  <BR>
Be sure to check <em>Calendar </em>handout for required   assigned readings and the project <em>FAQ and Clarifications</em> page on Blackboard! </p>
<h3>What File To Turn In and How to Turn In Your Work using Blackboard<br>
</h3>
<p>You must turn in your C++ program source file, which must be named <font color="#6600CC" size="+1"><em><strong>isp.cpp</strong></em></font><em><BR>
</em><BR>
Be 100% certain you have <STRONG><EM>thoroughly</EM></STRONG> read the handout entitled <STRONG><EM>"Submitting Your Program Assignments Electronically Using   Blackboard"</EM></STRONG> for complete instructions on how to submit and how to <STRONG>verify your submission</STRONG> after you submit it.&nbsp; This will help you   to avoid losing large numbers of project points due to improper submission   issues. This handout is available on the course web site under   "Handouts."<BR>
